# QA Notes

_Last verified: 2026-11-04 by QA agent_

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for general setup and
[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the architecture and other packages' commands.

## Frontend checks

Verified with Node 22.22.1, npm 9.2.0 and Vitest 5.1.0. The frontend uses
React, Vite and Zustand; component and store tests use happy-dom.

From `frontend/`:

```sh
npm ci --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund
npm test
npx vitest run src/store/
npx vitest run src/store/shared-routines.reload-newer.test.jsx
node scripts/check-locales.mjs
node scripts/check-source-strings.mjs --strict
npm run build
```

The workflow in `.github/workflows/test.yml` runs the whole suite with coverage,
the web build and locale checks. Its source-string check is report-only; the
command above uses strict mode. There is no separate lint or TypeScript check.

## Weight-rate timezone checks

_Verified: 2026-11-07 by QA agent_

From `frontend/`, run each timezone in a fresh process so module-level fixture
dates use that zone:

```sh
TZ=Pacific/Auckland npx vitest run src/lib/bodyweight-rate.test.js
TZ=UTC npx vitest run src/lib/bodyweight-rate.test.js
TZ=America/Los_Angeles npx vitest run src/lib/bodyweight-rate.test.js
```

For adjacent bodyweight, display, unit and date-format behavior at UTC+14:

```sh
TZ=Pacific/Kiritimati npx vitest run src/lib/bodyweight-rate.test.js src/lib/bodyweight.test.js src/components/WeightRate.test.jsx src/views/Stats.bodyweight.test.jsx src/lib/units.test.js src/lib/format.helpers.test.js --maxWorkers=2
```

Date-only fixtures must use local calendar dates: start at noon, subtract days
with `setDate`, then format with `isoOf`. `toISOString()` uses UTC and can move
the fixture to the previous date; subtracting 86400000 also crosses DST poorly.

## Shared routines

- `src/store/shared-routines.reload-newer.test.jsx` holds controlled GET/DELETE
  orderings for Accept, Decline, Remove, revokes and account changes.
  It mocks the API and UI toast; it cannot verify the actual toast component or navigation.
- `src/views/Plan.shared-tab.test.jsx` covers pending cards, confirmations,
  offline controls and accessible labels. `src/views/SharedRoutineView.test.jsx`
  covers the read-only routine and Remove confirmation.
- Browser checks should use synthetic accounts and routines. Exercise Accept,
  Decline and Remove with cancel/confirm, offline answers, retry after an error,
  and owner revocation. Verify schedule cleanup and preserved workout history.
  Control the network so a GET lands after DELETE applies but before its response.

## Plan import and Coach-created plans

From `frontend/`, run the slot allowlist, export/import round-trip, API parity,
Coach validation/application and shared-routine regression tests together:

```sh
npx vitest run src/lib/plan-share.test.js src/lib/shared-routine-parity.test.js src/lib/coach.test.js src/lib/shared-routines.test.js src/lib/shared-routines.boundary.test.js src/sheets.save-as-routine-shared.test.jsx --maxWorkers=2
```

For browser checks, use a synthetic plan JSON through Plan's file input. Check
Cancel, Add, malformed JSON, unchanged scheduling when the schedule switch is
off, and persistence after reload. Unknown slot fields must not survive import.

## API checks

From `api/` (Node 22):

```sh
npm ci --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund
npm test
```

The suite uses local fixtures and mock providers; no real Coach credentials are
needed. Neither package defines a separate lint or type-check command.

## Known gaps

`scripts/app-icons.test.mjs` currently has two failures comparing committed icons
with fresh renders on this Linux runtime. They reproduce on the unchanged base;
run `npx vitest run scripts/app-icons.test.mjs` to isolate them. Do not regenerate
icons as part of unrelated frontend changes.

## API checks

Verified with Node 22.22.1 and npm 9.2.0. The API is plain JavaScript on
`node:http`; its suite uses the built-in Node test runner. From `api/`:

```sh
npm ci --omit=optional --no-audit --no-fund
npm test
node --test test/server-reminder.test.js test/server-nudge.test.js
```

There is no API build, lint or type-check script. For the API job's coverage and
reporter options, see `.github/workflows/test.yml`. Its other checks, from the
repository root (install the root dependencies first):

```sh
npm ci --omit=optional --no-audit --no-fund
node scripts/build-coach-assets.mjs --check
node scripts/build-api-docs.mjs --check
node api/scripts/check-core-loadable.mjs
```

The reminder and nudge integration tests spawn the real server with `PORT=0`,
an isolated temporary `DATA_DIR`, and a shortened `REMINDER_TICK_MS`. Their
fixtures and cleanup live in `api/test/`; no account or push provider is needed.
`boundPort()` in `api/test/helpers.mjs` waits for the bound port's boot line.

Payload-failure tests opt into `--import ./test/fail-push.mjs` and toggle the
file named by `PUSH_FAULT_FILE`. They check unchanged database contents and
mtime, retry after recovery, and one failure log across repeated ticks. The
local-date rollover of failure logging is not automated: `userNow()` uses
`new Date()`, while `test/fake-clock.mjs` only patches `Date.now()`. Review the
date comparison in `payloadFailed()` when changing this behavior.

`push-messages.test.js` covers routine-field normalization and language
fallbacks. `server-bad-input.test.js` exercises malformed stored language on
an actual rest-timer callback; `server-push-status.test.js` covers timer
routing, cancellation and throttling. These tests establish send attempts,
not delivery to a device.
